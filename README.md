# FBLA-Aspire

Version 1.0 1/2/2026

## Description

FBLA Aspire is Varun Rajam’s 2026 FBLA Mobile App Development project. It is a professional mobile application designed to unify FBLA chapter members and official FBLA digital resources into one centralized platform. By consolidating these resources, the app increases awareness of FBLA events and ensures users stay up to date with official FBLA news.

The target audience for FBLA Aspire includes students who participate in their school’s FBLA chapter, as well as chapter advisors and teachers. Currently, FBLA distributes information across multiple platforms, such as websites, emails, and social media. Because different information is shared on different platforms, important updates can be overlooked, creating gaps in communication between FBLA executives and chapter members.

FBLA Aspire addresses this issue by providing a single, reliable source of official FBLA information. The app features preloaded official FBLA resources, an integrated FBLA events calendar, direct links to official FBLA social media platforms, and the official FBLA Newsroom embedded within the app. By centralizing these tools, FBLA Aspire enables faster, more effective communication and ensures that all users receive accurate and consistent information without knowledge gaps.
