# FBLA Aspire

**Version:** 1.0  
**Date:** January 2, 2026

## Overview
FBLA Aspire is Varun Rajam’s 2026 FBLA Mobile App Development project. It is a professional mobile application designed to unify FBLA chapter members and official FBLA digital resources into one centralized platform. By consolidating these resources, the app increases awareness of FBLA events and ensures users stay up to date with official FBLA news.

## Problem Statement
Currently, FBLA distributes information across multiple platforms, including websites, emails, and social media. Because different information is shared on different platforms, important updates can be overlooked. This fragmentation creates communication gaps between FBLA executives, chapter advisors, and student members.

FBLA Aspire addresses this issue by providing a single, reliable source of official FBLA information. The application centralizes essential resources and communication tools to ensure users receive accurate, consistent, and timely information without knowledge gaps.
